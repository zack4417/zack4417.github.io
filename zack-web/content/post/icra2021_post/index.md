**Propose a learning-based MPFC control paradigm for nonlinear systems under uncertain disturbances, coupling a high-level model predictive path following controller for proactivity with a low-level learning-based feedback linearization controller for adaptivity. Following that, nonlinear systems can rapidly
rejoin their reference trajectory after sudden wind disturbances with stability guarantees!**
