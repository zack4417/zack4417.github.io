**We presented a parallel trajectory optimization method for fast replanning for the EV  to achieve high travel efficiency in dense and congested traffic. Our approach efficiently generates feasible and safe candidate trajectories, while maintaining high computational efficiency based on the multiple-shooting and multi-threading techniques!**
