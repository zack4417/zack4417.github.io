title: Connected Cruise Control in Mixed Traffic Flow
summary: For safety-critical vehicles in mixed traffic flow where most vehicles are human-driven, each autonomous vehicle keeps tracking its front vehicle at a desired constant speed while maintaining a safe following distance with it in normal situations. However, when a vehicle decelerates urgently in unexpected situations, the vehicle behind has to reduce its speed to avoid collision with the front vehicle. In these cases, there exists a conflict between safety and stable high-performance tracking. For safety-critical autonomous vehicles, safety must not be violated and the tracking errors should be kept as small as possible.
