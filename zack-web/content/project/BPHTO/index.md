title: Barrier-Enhanced Homotopic Parallel Trajectory Optimization for Safety-Critical Autonomous Driving
summary:  Enforcing safety while preventing overly conservative behaviors is essential for autonomous vehicles to achieve high task performance. In this project, we propose a barrier-enhanced homotopic parallel trajectory optimization approach with over-relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers for real-time integrated decision-making and planning in cluttered driving environments. [Through a series of experiments, the proposed development demonstrates improved task accuracy, stability, and consistency in various traffic scenarios using synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pVSoaKdr3M)
