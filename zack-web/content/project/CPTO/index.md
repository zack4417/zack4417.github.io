title: Safe and Real-Time Consistent Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Partially Observed Environments via Parallel Consensus Optimization
summary:  This research introduces a consistent parallel trajectory optimization (CPTO) approach for real-time, consistent, and safe trajectory planning for autonomous driving in partially observed environments. The CPTO framework introduces a consensus safety barrier module, ensuring that each generated trajectory maintains a consistent and safe segment, even when faced with varying levels of obstacle detection accuracy. We validate our CPTO framework through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines across multiple driving tasks in partially observable environments. [Our results demonstrate improved safety and consistency using both synthetic and real-world traffic datasets.](https://youtu.be/nRCLG5oOxFU)
