title:   Multi-Modal Spatiotemporal Receding Horizon Planning for Autonomous Driving  

summary:  This project presents a cutting-edge approach for safe and efficient autonomous driving in dense traffic scenarios. Our proposed Spatiotemporal Receding Horizon Control (ST-RHC) scheme generates dynamically feasible and energy-efficient trajectories in real-time, enabling vehicles to accurately perform complex driving tasks. The algorithm employs receding horizon optimization and iterative parallel methods to design a trajectory tree that optimizes planning and ensures proactive interaction to avoid accidents. We have implemented our algorithms on an autonomous car, successfully achieving vehicle following, lane changing, overtaking, and cruise driving in dense traffic flow simulations based on ROS2.
