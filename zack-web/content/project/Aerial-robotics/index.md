title: Safety-critical Agricultural Drone
summary: To achieve [high-speed autonomous flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P86aRglDjE) of aerial vehicles and realize high-performance precision spraying in precision farming. Trajectories must be generated in real-time to avoid collision and be close to the reference spraying path. Because of the high navigation speed, short sensing range, and unknown environments, response time is extremely limited, making generating high-quality trajectories a significant challenge.
