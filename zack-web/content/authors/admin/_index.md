I am a PHD student in the [Thrust of Robotics and Autonomous Systems (ROAS)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/systems-hub/robotics-and-autonomous-systems) under the [Systems Hub](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/systems-hub)
 at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/) under [Guangzhou Pilot Scheme](https://ebookshelf.ust.hk/flippingbook/G21571_Hub/). Before that, I worked as a senior robotics engineer at [XAG](https://www.xa.com/en). The associated trajectory replanning algorithm and safe backup policy have been used in over 50 countries and regions.

My research interests include Autonomous Driving, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Multi-agent Systems, Motion Planning and Safe Learning-based Control.
